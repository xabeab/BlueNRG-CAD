BlueNRG-CAD
======
CAD files to produce the mechanical enclosure and circuits for a BLE device monitoring movement.

The mechanical parts were designed using CATIA. A student license is necessary to open the files. The STL files are available for 3D printing using PLA. 
The ACM_base_1 part is compatible with AppleWatch bands serie 4. It should be used for ankles and wrists.
The ACM_base_2 can be attached to a belt or any piece of thick clothing.

The circuit was designed using KiCad. All GERBER files are available for immediate production. A battery of around 160 mAh should be connected using a JST connector. 

This repository is part of the Activity Recognition based on Movement project, which is a complete open-source hardware and software solution of wearable BLE accelerometers + gyroscopes allowing activity recognition.
